/*
here are the commands:

fixed , setpercision() // we use them together

scientific , showpoint

uppercase

boolalpha

showpos ==> for showing the positive sign in front of the nums

noshowpos

setw() ===> cout<<"["<<setw(5)<<1234<<"]";      // [ 1234]

        u can make the nums on the left with ===> setiosflags(ios::left);

showbase ===> to show different repersentation of nums

        like ===> cout<< showbase << oct << 14;  // 016
        there's also hex


sometimes your program writes something , then carshes , but NOT everything
you wrote so far appears , why?!

        there's a reading in the slides (lesson 232)
        but to force it to print we use (FLUSH)

        cout<<"something" << endl << flush;

        alot of using it make the printing slow

to print something as error ===> use cerr

         its advantage is that It isn't buffered  so there's no need to flush
